# Java LiMS Development guides and documents

Before start developing or contributing to this project, you should follow some rules in this project

## Design Pattern 

We have looked through several design patterns and we have decided to use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. This pattern is widely used in the industry and it is easy to understand and implement. You can find more information about the MVC design pattern [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

Pros:
- Easy to understand
- Coding reusability, readability and maintainability
- Separation of concerns

Cons:
- Not suitable for small projects
- Can be complex for beginners
- Package structure can be complex

## Coding Standards

We have decided to use the Google Java Style Guide for this project. This is because it is widely used in the industry and it is easy to understand and implement. You can find the style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
